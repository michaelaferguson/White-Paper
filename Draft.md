*(I'm writing on behalf of the family business)*

**Intro**

As a part of the outdoor industry, the state of the environment is important to us. We consider ourselves amateur environmentalists and do our part locally in hopes to make impacts globally. Over the years, a change we’ve made as a family and team is our meat consumption. Some have gone vegetarian, others stopped eating meat that comes from factory farms because of the environmental hazards they can create. 

We are interested in the reversal of climate change and realize how big of a task that is. In this document, you will find our research about the impacts the meat industry makes on the environment and details on the solution we will advocate to eat meat in a sustainable way.

The topic of meat consumption can be a controversial one, and we are not looking to convince you on the ethics of eating meat but rather demonstrate the long-term effects this industry has on our planet. 


**Some history**

In the United States specifically, a majority of meat and dairy products sold come from factory farms, also known as CAFOs (Concentrated Animal Feeding Operations). The end of World War II shifted livestock coming from small, family owned farms to a larger production due to the technological boom in agriculture machinery. From there, it has grown exponentially. The production of meat from cattle alone in 2010 was 12 million – double the amount of the next highest producer worldwide, China. (FAO)


**Stats on greenhouse gases**

“When all of its impacts are added together, from clearing land to growing feed with fertilizer and managing manure, the global livestock industry generates more greenhouse gases than the transportation sector of the economy.” (CQ Researcher)

**Conclusion**
*call to action; you don't have to be vegetarian to make an impact, but being more conscious of your consumption is huge*
