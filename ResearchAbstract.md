I would like to write my white paper about animal agriculture and its impact on the environment. I have been a vegetarian for many years for multiple reasons, one is because of the damage the factory-farmed meat industry has done to the climate. I will research the amounts of methane this industry produces, how it can be more limited, and how to eat meat sustainably. My intended audience is the general public interested in making a difference in their daily lives. My call to action will be to eat a more plant-based diet - not necessarily to become a vegan or vegetarian, but to be conscious of the meats they are consuming. These sites all have helpful information on the stats of meat consumption, the industry's greenhouse gas emissions, and the logistics of eating meat in a sustainable way.
