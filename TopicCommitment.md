I am committing to my findings from the research abstract about the big meat industry and its environmental impacts. I will provide stats on American meat consumption, the industry's greenhouse gas emissions, and the logistics of eating meat in a sustainable way. This could benefit the small and local farms whose practices are generally much more sustainable, but I guess I am still figuring out a more specific audience.
